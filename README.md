aindrops that will continue to fall and expand on the screen, as your mouse controls night and day by moving it across the screen so you can relax and enjoy the comforting view of a light shower rippling in a puddle.

Sorry that its not that interesting more then a slight comfort. I couldn't think of anything other then waves or raindrops as something that would be nice to watch and be different each time, procedurally created and also allowing the user to interact with it.

Also yes I know the raindrops all appear at once, I can't think of how to make it so they appear at different times. And sorry that the Y axis does nothing, again I can't think of what to put there that would be thematic with it other then some relaxing/melancholic music but I couldn't program that in as the code never worked.
